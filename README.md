OpenCodes Hackathon 2018  - Tinder is so 2017

## The pitch
This project was created during the OpenCodes Hackathon 2018 in Karlsruhe.
The idea behind the project is, to build a non linear social app, which connects new people by matching their personalities.  To achive this, we ask the user a few base questions, that will indicate the users demands, e.g. dating or friendship. After that, the user can ask own questions, aswell as answer the questions from other users nearby.  If two users have matching answers, both get a match in their matchlist. They now habe the oppertunity to chat and potentially meet each other.

The clue with the questions? The answers are emojicons üëçüëå
