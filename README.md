Dating App developed at OpenCodes Hackathon 2018

## :clipboard: about

The idea behind the project is, to build a non linear social app, which connects people by matching their personalities. To achive this, we ask the user a few basic questions, that will indicate the users demands, e.g. dating or friendship. After that, the user can ask own questions, aswell as answer the questions from other users nearby. If two users have matching answers, both get a match in their matchlist. They now habe the oppertunity to chat and get to know each other. üëçüëå
